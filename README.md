# imd_tool
An interactive visualization tool that transforms probabilistic programming models into an interactive multiverse diagram. Intented for interactive exploration of the uncertainty of Bayesian probabilistic models and enhancement of their interpretability. It takes as an input the model-related information and the inference results of a probabilistic programming model into a zip file of a collection of npy arrays along with a metadata file. This input should be according to the output produced by the [arviz_json](https://github.com/johnhw/arviz_json) package.
